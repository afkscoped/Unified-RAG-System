# TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION: AETHER_DRIVE_SYSTEM_v4.2

## 01_OVERVIEW
The Aether Drive is a non-Newtonian propulsion system that utilizes zero-point energy fluctuations to generate localized gravitational gradients. Unlike conventional chemical rockets, the Aether Drive does not require propellant mass, instead leveraging the "Antigravity" effect produced by rotating superconducting rings at relativistic speeds.

## 02_CORE_COMPONENTS
- **Graviton Ring (GR-1)**: A hollow torus filled with liquid helium and a suspended superconducting ceramic.
- **Flux Capacitor (v2)**: Not for time travel, but for stabilizing the massive energy discharge required during the "Ignition Phase".
- **Singularity Core**: A microscopic artificial singularity contained within an electromagnetic bottle, used as the primary energy source.

## 03_OPERATIONAL_PROCEDURES
### Ignition Sequence
1. Pre-cool the Graviton Ring to 4.2 Kelvin.
2. Initiate the Singular Core spin-up to 450,000 RPM.
3. Discharge the Flux Capacitor into the primary excitation coil.
4. Monitor for "Event Horizon Stability" (must stay above 98.4%).

### Navigation & Steering
Steering is achieved by modulating the localized gravity field. Increasing the power to the bow-side emitters creates a "pull" effect, effectively falling toward the destination at speeds exceeding 0.1c.

## 04_SAFETY_PROTOCOLS
- **Vibration Alert**: If the hull frequency exceeds 14kHz, immediately decouple the Singularity Core.
- **Exposure**: Personnel should not enter the Drive Room during active propulsion without Lead-Aether shielding. Prolonged exposure can lead to "temporal desynchronization".

## 05_MAINTENANCE_LOGS
- **Date: 2026-01-15**: Replaced the ceramic bushings in the GR-1. Slight residue of exotic matter detected but cleared during routine purging.
- **Date: 2026-01-20**: Calibrated the electromagnetic bottle. Stability at 99.9%.
